# The Uses and Dangers of Lasers

Now I know we all have seen the little dollar store pet laser that you can barely see after 20 ft. Don't get me wrong, for that price my cat is more than enough entertained; but lasers have way more uses than making dogs go in circles over and over. When the laser's quality increases, they then gain the potential to burn whatever comes across their path. Now depending on the reason you would ever want one of these monstrosities, they are compleatly harmless if you follow the standard safty procedure for using high powered lasers. Safety measures used with the more powerful lasers include the following: key-controlled operation, warning lights to indicate laser beam emission, a beam stop or attenuator (to reduce laser strength), and an electrical contact that the user can connect to an emergency stop of laser emission, or interlock. These are the most basic of saftey measures for high powered lasers and there is good reason for them.
    
# The Uses
    
<p>There are many benefitial uses for lasers and here are a few</p>
<ol>
<li>sensors for security reasons</li>
<li>making designs in metal or wood</li>
<li>Printing</li>
<li>lasers surgery and skin treatments</li>
<li>measuring range and speed</li>
<li>cutting metal and other materials</li>
<li>3D printing</li>
</ol>

    <h1>The Dangers</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Eyes</li>
        <li>skin</li>
        <li>Hair</li>
        <li>Materials</li>
    </ul>
<p>One of the first things you hear when playing with a laser is "Don't shine that in anyone's eye" then a scream would follow when that person doesn't listen. We've all had some similar expirence, but is there a reason to be so cautious!? well, yes. Even though there are some lasers that show no eye damage at all even after several hours of contact. Those are class 1 lasers. They are the weakest of the weak and wont harm your eyes or skin. But then there are class 2 lasers which may be harmful if you view the laser with an optical instument like bionoculars. If you want stronger there are class 3 lasers, these are harmful to eyes, skin, and can burn materials if exsposer lasts. Then you reach the most dangerous of the laser family, the class 4 lasres. These lasers can cause permanate eye damage and burn skin as well as hair instantly. You even have to be careful of the reflecting beames if it hits mirrors or a crystal ball. Needless to say that they can be dangerous.</p></li>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>So with all the facts in place, and both the danger and use spectrum is exposed; should we still use lasers? Are they too dangerous for us to sell and use them? Well in my opinion, there are way too many benefits for use to stop their use. They might be dngerous, but have you seen a serial laser attacker? Exactly. With their huge price tag and hunger for power, youll most likely only see the stonger lasers in labratorys and proper carving setups. So sit back and enjoy all the good things about lasers. </p>
